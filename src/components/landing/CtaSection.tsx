// This component has been moved to FinalCtaSection.tsx
// This file can be deleted if no longer referenced, or kept as a stub.
// For safety, providing a minimal export or null component.

export function CtaSection() {
  return null; 
}

// If you want to ensure this file is truly empty or explicitly marks the component as obsolete:
// export default function CtaSection_DEPRECATED() { return null; }
// Or simply leave it with the minimal export above if the build system handles tree-shaking.
