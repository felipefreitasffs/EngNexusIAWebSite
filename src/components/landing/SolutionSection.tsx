// This file is effectively replaced by InteractiveSolutionSection.tsx
// Keeping it here to avoid breaking existing imports if any, but it should be removed
// or its contents replaced if InteractiveSolutionSection.tsx is used instead.
// For this task, I'm assuming InteractiveSolutionSection.tsx is the new component.
// This file can be deleted if page.tsx is updated to use the new component.

// To prevent errors, I'll provide a minimal placeholder.
// Or, if page.tsx was using SolutionSection, it should be updated to use InteractiveSolutionSection.
// Given the PRD, it's a replacement. So, this file is now obsolete.

// For the sake of providing valid XML, I'll clear its content or provide a stub.
// Since page.tsx is being updated, this file will no longer be imported from there.
// Let's leave it empty to signify it's deprecated / replaced.

export function SolutionSection() {
  return null; // This component is replaced by InteractiveSolutionSection
}
